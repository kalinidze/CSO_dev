With the introduction of `included_events`/`excluded_events` you can configure filtering per each event type.\n* Replace the `filter.event_filters.path_filter` with the appropriate `resource_scope` blocks. You have to account that `resource_scope` does not support specifying relations between resources, so your configuration will simplify to only the actual resources, that will be monitored.\n\n* Replace the `filter.path_filter` block with the `filtering_policy.management_events_filter`. New API states management events filtration in a more clear way. The resources, that were specified, must migrate into the `filtering_policy.management_events_filter.resource_scope`.\n\n## Example usage\n\n```terraform\n//\n// Create a new basic Audit Trails Trail\n//\nresource \"yandex_audit_trails_trail\" \"basic-trail\" {\n  name        = \"basic-trail\"\n  folder_id   = \"home-folder\"\n  description = \"Some trail description\"\n\n  labels = {\n    key = \"value\"\n  }\n\n  service_account_id = \"trail-service-account\"\n\n  logging_destination {\n    log_group_id = \"some-log-group\"\n  }\n\n  filtering_policy {\n    management_events_filter {\n      resource_scope {\n        resource_id   = \"home-folder\"\n        resource_type = \"resource-manager.folder\"\n      }\n    }\n    data_events_filter {\n      service = \"storage\"\n      resource_scope {\n        resource_id   = \"home-folder\"\n        resource_type = \"resource-manager.folder\"\n      }\n    }\n    data_events_filter {\n      service = \"dns\"\n      resource_scope {\n        resource_id   = \"vpc-net-id-1\"\n        resource_type = \"vpc.network\"\n      }\n      resource_scope {\n        resource_id   = \"vpc-net-id-2\"\n        resource_type = \"vpc.network\"\n      }\n      dns_filter {\n        include_nonrecursive_queries = true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```terraform\n//\n// Create Trail for delivering events to YDS and gathering such events:\n// * Management events from the 'some-organization' organization.\n// * DNS data events with only recursive queries from the 'some-organization' organization.\n// * Object Storage data events from the 'some-organization' organization.\n//\nresource \"yandex_audit_trails_trail\" \"basic_trail\" {\n  name        = \"a-trail\"\n  folder_id   = \"home-folder\"\n  description = \"Some trail description\"\n\n  labels = {\n    key = \"value\"\n  }\n\n  service_account_id = \"trail-service-account\"\n\n  data_stream_destination {\n    database_id = \"some-database\"\n    stream_name = \"some-stream\"\n  }\n\n  filtering_policy {\n    management_events_filter {\n      resource_scope {\n        resource_id   = \"some-organization\"\n        resource_type = \"organization-manager.organization\"\n      }\n    }\n    data_events_filter {\n      service = \"storage\"\n      resource_scope {\n        resource_id   = \"some-organization\"\n        resource_type = \"organization-manager.organization\"\n      }\n    }\n    data_events_filter {\n      service = \"dns\"\n      resource_scope {\n        resource_id   = \"some-organization\"\n        resource_type = \"organization-manager.organization\"\n      }\n      dns_filter {\n        include_nonrecursive_queries = true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```terraform\n//\n// Migration from deprecated filter field\n//\n\n// Before replacing \"filter.event_filters.path_filter\" to the \"resource_scope\" block.\nevent_filters {\n  path_filter {\n    some_filter {\n      resource_id   = \"home-folder\"\n      resource_type = \"resource-manager.folder\"\n      any_filters {\n        resource_id   = \"vpc-net-id-1\"\n        resource_type = \"vpc.network\"\n      }\n      any_filters {\n        resource_id   = \"vpc-net-id-2\"\n        resource_type = \"vpc.network\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// After replacing \"filter.event_filters.path_filter\" to the \"resource_scope\" block.\ndata_events_filter {\n  service = \"dns\"\n  resource_scope {\n    resource_id   = \"vpc-net-id-1\"\n    resource_type = \"vpc.network\"\n  }\n  resource_scope {\n    resource_id   = \"vpc-net-id-2\"\n    resource_type = \"vpc.network\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```terraform\n//\n// Migration from deprecated filter field\n//\n\n// Before replacing \"filter.path_filter block to the \"filtering_policy.management_events_filter\" block.\nfilter {\n  path_filter {\n    any_filter {\n      resource_id   = \"home-folder\"\n      resource_type = \"resource-manager.folder\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// After replacing \"filter.path_filter block to the \"filtering_policy.management_events_filter\" block.\nfiltering_policy {\n  management_events_filter {\n    resource_scope {\n      resource_id   = \"home-folder\"\n      resource_type = \"resource-manager.folder\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->\n## Schema\n\n### Required\n\n- `folder_id` (String) The folder identifier that resource belongs to.

For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-postgresql/). [How to connect to the DB](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-postgresql/quickstart#connect). To connect, use port 6432. The port number is not configurable.\n\n~> Historically, `user` and `database` blocks of the `yandex_mdb_postgresql_cluster` resource were used to manage users and databases of the PostgreSQL cluster. However, this approach has many disadvantages. In particular, adding and removing a resource from the terraform recipe worked wrong because terraform misleads the user about the planned changes. Now, the recommended way to manage databases and users is using `yandex_mdb_postgresql_user` and `yandex_mdb_postgresql_database` resources.\n\n## Example usage\n\n```terraform\n//\n// Create a new

To generate these keys, you will need a Service Account with the appropriate permissions.\n\n~> For extended API usage, such as setting the `max_size`, `folder_id`, `anonymous_access_flags`, `default_storage_class`, and `https` parameters for a bucket, only the default authorization method will be used. This means the `IAM` token from the `provider` block will be applied.\nThis can be confusing in cases where a separate service account is used for managing buckets because, in such scenarios,buckets may be accessed by two different accounts, each with potentially different permissions for the buckets.\n\n~> In case you are using IAM token from UserAccount, you are needed to explicitly specify `folder_id` in the resource, as it cannot be identified from such type of account. In case you are using IAM token from ServiceAccount or static access keys, `folder_id` does not need to be specified unless you want to create the resource in a different folder than the account folder.\n\n~> Terraform will import this resource with `force_destroy` set to `false` in state. If you've set it to `true` in config, run `terraform apply` to update the value set in state. If you delete this resource before updating the value, objects in the bucket will not be destroyed.\n\n## Example usage\n\n```terraform\n//\n// Create a new Storage Bucket. \n//\nprovider \"yandex\"

When Terraform drops the management (i.e. when resource is deleted from statefile and management), the state of the security group **remains the same** as it was before the deletion.\n\n~> Duplicating a resource (specifying same `network_id` for two different default security groups) will cause errors in the apply stage of your's configuration.\n\n## Example usage\n\n```terraform\n//\n// Update rules in Default Security Group.\n//\nresource \"yandex_vpc_default_security_group\" \"default-sg\" {\n  description = \"description for default security group\"\n  network_id  = yandex_vpc_network.lab-net.id\n\n  labels = {\n    my-label = \"my-label-value\"\n  }\n\n  ingress {\n    protocol       = \"TCP\"\n    description    = \"rule1 description\"\n    v4_cidr_blocks = [\"10.0.1.0/24\", \"10.0.2.0/24\"]\n    port           = 8080\n  }\n\n  egress {\n    protocol       = \"ANY\"\n    description    = \"rule2 description\"\n    v4_cidr_blocks = [\"10.0.1.0/24\", \"10.0.2.0/24\"]\n    from_port      = 8090\n    to_port        = 8099\n  }\n\n  egress {\n    protocol       = \"UDP\"\n    description    = \"rule3 description\"\n    v4_cidr_blocks = [\"10.0.1.0/24\"]\n    from_port      = 8090\n    to_port        = 8099\n  }\n}\n\n// Auxiliary resources\nresource \"yandex_vpc_network\" \"lab-net\" {\n  name = \"lab-network\"\n}\n```\n\n<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->\n## Schema\n\n### Required\n\n- `network_id` (String) ID of the network this security group belongs to.\n\n### Optional\n\n- `description` (String) The resource description.\n- `egress` (Block Set) A list of egress rules.
